# Time-Series-Project

The Electricity Consumption was performed on hourly data using XGBoost.

## Techniques like
  - Lag features
  - Time series cross-validation 
  - Hyperparameter tuning are used to enhance the model's training capabilities.

## There could be several factors that affect electricity consumption, such as
- Weather conditions: As the weather starts to change in the months near March and October, there could be an increase in electricity consumption due to the use of heating or cooling systems, such as air conditioners, heaters, and fans.

- Seasonal changes: In some regions, there may be seasonal changes in the demand for electricity due to holidays, festivals, or other events that occur in the months near March and October.

- Daylight saving time: The beginning and end of daylight saving time can also affect electricity consumption, as people adjust their daily routines and use more electricity during different times of the day.

- Industrial demand: In some areas, there may be an increase in industrial demand for electricity during the months near March and October, which can affect overall consumption levels.

## Integrating External WEATHER DATA
The project incorporates external weather data such as hourly temperature, humidity, and more, sourced from NASA POWER.
The objective of integrating weather data is to understand the impact of environmental factors on electricity consumption. \
For instance, during the summer season, there is a surge in consumption due to the operation of refrigeration appliances like air conditioners and deep freezers.
